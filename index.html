                [Verse 1]
                You made it through another day
                You made it through another day
                You did it, let's celebrate, oh, oh
                Some days, you feel you'll break
                But you made it through another day
                Yeah, you did it, let's celebrate, oh
            </p>

            <p>
                [Pre-Chorus]
                24/7 and 365
                You made another day, made it alive
                Made another day, made it alive (Yeah)
                24/7 and 365
                You made another day, made it alive
                Made another day, made it alive
            </p>

                [Chorus]
                So today, baby
                Remember it's okay
                We're all floatin' through space (Floatin' through)
                Today, baby

                [Verse 2]
                We are like grains of sand
                Better to be holdin' hands
                Better to be holdin' hands, oh
                We are like grains of sand
                Better to be holdin' hands
                Better to be holdin' hands, yeah
